THE CATALOG FILES.

The model considers two IR source populations, the basic population and the
very high flux population. In all cases, the format of the catalogs are as
follows:

-each line correspods to a distinct IR galaxy, with these entries:

COLUMN 1: Halo ID (integer kind=4)
COLUMN 2: ra (degrees, real kind=4)
COLUMN 3: dec (degrees, real kind=4)
COLUMN 4: redshift (real kind=4)
COLUMNS 5-10: fluxes at 30, 90, 148, 219, 277, 350 GHz in mJy units, (real kind=4)



* For the basic population, the data can be found in a set of smaller files,
  in ASCII format. All these files can be found in IRBasicPop.tar.gz.

  The smaller files are called

  "IRgal_S_#.dat"

  The integer "#" in the filenames are related to the flux of the sources
  within each file. For each IR source, the integer "#" is computed as

     #=INT(1+(nfiles-1.)*log(S/Smax)/log(S/Smin) ),

where

  nfiles=11,

and

  Smin = 1.e-2,
  Smax = 3.e2,

and

  S is the 350 GHz flux of the IR source (in mJy).

  However, within each file, IR galaxies are *not* sorted in terms of their
  flux.



* For the BLAST very high flux population, there is a file in ASCII
  format, called "IRBlastPop.dat".  This file has ~300 galaxies in an
  octant.
