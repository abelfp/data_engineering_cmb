The TPM N-body code was run with 1024^3 particles in a 1000 Mpc/h box. Halos were identified using a 
friends-of-friends algorithm and those belonging to a light cone spanning an octant for redshifts 0 < z < 3 have 
been saved.

SZ maps are available as binary FITS files with the minimum header. Maps are in Healpix format with Nside = 8192 
and Npix = 12*Nside^2. Full sky maps are constructed by replicating the octant as follow:

Northern hemisphere
theta_N = theta_O
phi_N   = phi_O + n*pi/2 where n = 0,1,2,3

Southern hemisphere
theta_S = pi - theta_N
phi_S   = 2*pi - phi_N


Sky_sz_nu.fits are distortion maps, in units of Delta T/T, at various GHz frequencies. These maps are for the 
redshift range 0 < z < 10. They include relativistic corrections.

Sky_tsz.fits and Sky_ksz.fits are the Compton y and Doppler b maps, respectively. These maps are for the same 
redshift range, but do not include relativistic corrections.

SZ halo catalogs are available in ascii and binary formats. There are 1414339 halos in the first octant for 
redshifts 0 < z < 3. For each halo, there are 48 numbers as described below.


Here is a sample codelet to read in the binary data file

  integer(4), parameter           :: nhalo = 1414339
  real(4),    dimension(48,nhalo) :: halo

  open(1,file='halo_sz.binary',form='binary')
  do i=1,nhalo
    read(1) halo(:,i)
  enddo
  close(1)
